    <h1>Priced Out</h1>
    <p>
        The history of urban renewal in the United States, as seen through these sources from the late 19th century to the early 1970s, reveals a consistent narrative of tension between modernization and community identity.
        While the term "gentrification" is rarely used in these 1970s documents, the mechanics—displacement of low-income populations, the demolition of "blighted" structures, and the push for higher-value commercial and residential use—form its foundational story.
