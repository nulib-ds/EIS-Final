# About

Using [IIIF collections and manifests](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#21-defined-types) as a data source, Canopy IIIF (Canopy) generates a scholarly digital projects platform that transforms provided digital collections into an accessible, discoverable research environment. Built on modern web standards and leveraging the interoperability of IIIF, Canopy creates static sites that extend existing IIIF resources while providing advanced localized search capabilities, contextual navigation, and customizable presentation layers.


## Colophon

Canopy was created by [Mat Jordan](https://github.com/mathewjordan) _(Northwestern University)_ and [Mark Baggett](https://github.com/markpbaggett) _(Texas A&M University)_ as a method to quickly build exhibit style digital humanities projects that extend existing digital collections using IIIF Collections and Manifests. It continues to be an active open-source initiative of [Northwestern University Libraries](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/), where it supports digital scholarship in many forms. This example site is built from the [Donald K. Adams and Lawrence D. Stewart Collection of Prints](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/94536627-cfdf-413c-852b-0cb16d986da3) and the [Indian Paintings on Mica](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/7ac5769f-a1d9-4227-a350-bf8bd8b1cddc) collection hosted by Northwestern University Libraries' [Digital Collections](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/).

Canopy uses the [IIIF Presentation API](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) to deliver rich media from providing institutions, [Markdown as MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for authoring contextual content and layout, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the user interface, and a static [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) index for search. Easy aggregation and retrieval of IIIF resources is made possible by the [IIIF helpers](https://github.com/IIIF-Commons/iiif-helpers) developed by [Stephen Fraser](https://github.com/stephenwf). In addition, [Clover IIIF](https://github.com/samvera-labs/clover-iiif), developed by Northwestern University Libraries with contributions from other institutions, is integral to Canopy and provides the rendering of IIIF resources, annotations, and metadata throughout the interface.
