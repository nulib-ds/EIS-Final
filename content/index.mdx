## Enrich your research with EIS

Explore digital resources from the Northwestern Library collections — including AI summaries, maps, timelines, and curated collections.

## Exolore featured exhibits

- Open `canopy.yml` and set `collection` to the IIIF Collection you want to feature.
- Review `metadata` and `featured` entries—adjust them to suit the facets and works you want to highlight.

## Research using our collection

- Customize `content/index.mdx`, `content/about/`, and add new folders under `content/` for exhibits or guides.
- Modify `content/works/_layout.mdx` to control how individual manifests render.
- Update `content/_app.mdx` to adjust site-wide structure.
- Browse the component catalog and usage patterns in the docs to extend the narrative beyond default manifests.
